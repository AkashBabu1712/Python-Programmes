Arrays-> in python can only contain elements of same data types i.e., data type of array should be homogeneous.
It is a thin wrapper around C language arrays and consumes far less memory than lists.

Lists-> in python can contain elements of different data types i.e., data type of lists can be heterogeneous.
It has the disadvantage of consuming large memory.
