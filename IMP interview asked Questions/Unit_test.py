"""
Unit test is a unit testing framework of Python.
Unit testing means testing different components of software separately. Can you think about why unit testing is important? Imagine a scenario, you are building software that uses three components namely A, B, and C.
Now, suppose your software breaks at a point time. How will you find which component was responsible for breaking the software? Maybe it was component A that failed, which in turn failed component B, and this actually failed the software.
There can be many such combinations.
This is why it is necessary to test each and every component properly so that we know which component might be highly responsible for the failure of the software
