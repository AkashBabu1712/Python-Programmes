a = [1,2,3]
b=a
c = [1,2,3]
print(a == c)
print(a is c)

A) True, True
B) True, False
c) False, True
D) False, False

Expalnation:

Let's break down the code step by step:

a = [1, 2, 3]: This line creates a list a containing the elements 1, 2, and 3.

b = a: This line assigns the reference of list a to variable b, meaning both a and b point to the same list object.

c = [1, 2, 3]: This line creates a new list c containing the same elements as a, but it's a separate list object in memory.

print(a == c): This line checks if the contents of lists a and c are equal. Since both lists have the same elements in the same order, this will print True.

print(a is c): This line checks if a and c refer to the same object in memory. Since a and c are different list objects, this will print False.

So, the output of the code will be:
True
False
